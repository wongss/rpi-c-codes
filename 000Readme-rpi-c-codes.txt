The code examples use interfaces found in the powerpoint slides "00RPi gpio conn.pptx" consisting of
- the breakout board
- i2c interfaces to LCD, keypad, LED & switches IO expander, and accelerometer. Note their i2c addresses.

Looks like there is problem uploading powerpoint file to github. Not sure why corrupted.
